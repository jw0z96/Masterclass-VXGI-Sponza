# TODO LIST
- reduced to single light (DONE)
- user control of rendering parameters
- fix conservative rasterization
- sparse texture representation
  - voxelise the scene once to get the number of voxel fragments (atomic counter)
  - create imageBuffers of the right size to store voxel fragments
  - voxelise the scene again to populate the imageBuffers, this is the voxel fragment list
  - build SVO structure (allocate all leaf nodes)
  - inject attributes into SVO (albedo & normal)
  - mipmap the SVO
- correct combination of shading components
- soft shadows
- normal weighted attenuation
- light intensity controls
- light attenuation
- light types (LOW PRIORITY)
- multiple lights (at runtime) (LOW PRIORITY)
- work with different MTL
